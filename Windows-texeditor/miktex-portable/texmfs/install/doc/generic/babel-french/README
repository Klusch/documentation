== PURPOSE ==

This bundle is an extension to the babel package for multilingual
typesetting. It provides all necessary macros, definitions and settings
to typeset French documents. It is designed to work with the following
engines: pdfTeX, XeTeX and LuaTeX.

== CONTENTS ==

The bundle consists of the following files:

* frenchb.ins: installation file to unpack the language definition files,
* frenchb.dtx: packed language definition files and documentation,
* frenchb.pdf: unpacked documentation for frenchb.ldf,
* README (this file).

== INSTALLATION ==

If the latest version of this package is not included in your LaTeX
distribution, do the following:

* issue "luatex frenchb.ins" to unpack the language definition files;
* copy the files frenchb.lua, french.ldf, frenchb.ldf, francais.ldf,
  acadian.ldf and canadien.ldf to a location where TeX can find them
  (default location: $TEXMF/tex/generic/babel-french/);
* rebuild the database (mktexlsr or so).

== DOCUMENTATION ==

See the included manual frenchb.pdf for usage instructions.
