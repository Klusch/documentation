This package provides an alternative to Babel for users of XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
(with a few languages incompletely supported for the latter). This version
includes support for 76 different languages.

Polyglossia makes it possible to automate the following tasks:

* Loading the appropriate hyphenation patterns.
* Setting the script and language tags of the current font (if possible and
  available), using the package fontspec.
* Switching to a font assigned by the user to a particular script or language.
* Adjusting some typographical conventions in function of the current language
  (such as afterindent, frenchindent, spaces before or after punctuation marks,
  etc.).
* Redefining the document strings (like “chapter”, “figure”, “bibliography”).
* Adapting the formatting of dates (for non-gregorian calendars via external
  packages bundled with polyglossia: currently the Hebrew, Islamic and Farsi
  calendars are supported).
* For languages that have their own numeration system, modifying the formatting
  of numbers appropriately.
* Ensuring the proper directionality if the document contains languages
  written from right to left (via the package bidi, available separately).
