                       History of the luamplib package

2018/01/04 2.12.2
    * workaround issue #70 "Labels outside beginfig...endfig are not inherited"
    * address issue #71 "metafun problem: arrow tips are not filled"
    by importing luatex-mplib.lua from context beta.

2017/06/02 2.12.1
    * when \mplibglobaltextext{enable} is declared, metapost variables
    containing btex ... etex labels can be inherited across code chunks.
    Of course, \mplibcodeinherit should also be switched on.

2016/03/31 2.11.3
    * fix a bug regarding nested mplibcode environments (issue #63)

2016/01/02 2.11.2
    * updates for luatex 0.87

2015/10/02 2.11.1
    * adapts to latex 2015/10/01 and luatexbase v1.0
    * allows `btex ... etex' and `verbatimtex ... etex' even when
      `\mplibverbatim{enable}' is declared.

2015/08/01 2.11.0
    * after `\mplibverbatim{enable}', contents of mplibcode environment
      will be read verbatim. So `btex ... etex', `verbatimtex ... etex',
      `\mpdim', `\mpcolor' are not allowed and all TeX commands will be
      fed literally into mplib library.
    * allow access to type1 fonts, which means we can use glyph
      operator now (luatex rev 5266)
    * color transparency is now compatible with pgf package and
      beamer class as well. (luatex 0.80+ is recommended)

2015/03/26 2.10.1
    * fix bug #55 regarding hash token

2015/03/20 2.10.0
    * TeX code in `VerbatimTeX()' between `beginfig();' and `endfig;'
      will be inserted after flushing out the mplib figure.
    * `\mpcolor' command accepts optional argument: for instance,
      `\mpcolor[HTML]{FF0000}'.

2015/01/26 2.9.1
    * fix a bug reported by Herbert Schulz via luatex mailing list
      (http://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2015-January/005054.html)

2015/01/05 2.9.0
    * after declaring `\mplibcodeinherit{enable}', each mplib code chunks
      will inherit variables/constants/macros defined by previous chunks.
      On the contrary, the default value `\mplibcodeinherit{disable}' will
      treat each code chunks as an independent instance, never being affected
      by other code chunks.

2014/07/04 2.8.1
    * support color package on plain tex.
    * fix a failure at `btex \% etex'.

2014/06/17 2.8.0
    * support color/xcolor/spotcolor packages.
      On LaTeX, color names or expressions of color/xcolor packages
      can be used inside mplibcode environment with the command
      \mpcolor{<color expression>}.

2014/04/25 2.7.0
    * support DVIPDFMx
    * default directory for cache is now '$TEXMFVAR/luamplib_cache'
    * internal changes following LuaTeX engine v0.79 and luatexbase
      package v0.7
    * [fix] avoid luatex crash under math_mode 'decimal'

2014/03/26 2.6.1
    * now luamplib does not disregard 'show' command, even if
      'luamplib.showlog' is false. Incidentally, it does not raise
      error, but just prints a warning, even if output contains
      no figure.
    * fix a bug wrt color, which might come to the fore under
      math mode 'double' or 'decimal'.

2014/03/08 2.6.0
    * new macro \mplibtextextlabel{enable} enables string labels typeset
      with textext() instead of infont operator. Every string label
      thereafter will be typeset with current TeX font.
    * fixed a bug wrt btex ... etex parsing (issue #39)
    * [doc] added a mention about \MPllx, \MPlly, \MPurx, and \MPury.

2014/03/01 2.5.3
    * using \mplibcachedir{<directory path>}, users can change the
      directory for storing cache files. By default, it is the directory
      where pdf output file is saved.
    * at the end of package loading, luamplib searches 'luamplib.cfg',
      and, when found, reads the file in automatically.

2014/02/24 2.5.2
    * new macros \mplibmakenocache{...} and \mplibcancelnocache{...} to
      register/unregister those .mp files that do not need caches.
      These macros affect the compilation speed only.
    * added a hack to support graph.mp (in fact, format.mp)
    * [fix] luamplib now respects percent sign if it is enclosed by quotes.

2014/02/19 2.5
    * btex ... etex input from external *.mp files will also be processed
      by luamplib. However, verbatimtex ... etex will be entirely ignored
      in this case.

2014/02/02 2.4
    * implemented "numbersystem" option. Default value "scaled" can be
      changed by declaring \mplibnumbersystem{double}. For details, see
      http://github.com/lualatex/luamplib/issues/21

2014/01/20 2.3
    * \everymplib, \everyendmplib: macros that redefine token lists
      \everymplibtoks and \everyendmplibtoks. These will be
      automatically inserted at the beginning and ending (respectively)
      of each and every mplib code.
    * naked TeX codes, includig \mpdim{...}, are allowed inside
      mplibcode environment. Refer the manual of gmp package for
      details.

2013/12/30 2.2
    * start to support transparency/shading under metafun format.
    * verbatimtex ... etex just before beginfig() is not ignored.
      Using this macro, each mplib box can be moved horizontally and/or
      vertically.

2013/12/23 2.1.1
    * fix a bug wrt "withoutcolor" option
    * fix a bug wrt "char <number> infont <font>" picture
    * bypass some ConTeXt commands which raise errors under metafun format
    * ignore "fontmapfile <filename>" which isn't needed in mplib

2013/12/19 2.1
    * Do not ignore "withcolor" option for textext and normal text object
    * verbatimtex ... etex is now just ignored, not raising error

2013/12/11 2.03
    * implemented textext() macro which is identical to TEX() from TEX.mp.
      TEX() is a synonym of textext().
    * fix a bug regarding tex-text box inside for...endfor loop,
      reported at http://www.ktug.org/xe/index.php?document_srl=178050

2013/09/24 2.01
    * fix bug reported by Stephan Hennig: wrong baseline of tex-text box

2013/05/07 2.0
    * Update with current ConTeXt code
    * Adding the possibility of btex...etex commands (Kim)

2011/12/09 1.09
    * Fix bug reported by Paul Vojta: spurious spaces.

2011/06/23 1.08
    * Fix bug reported by Rolf Dieterich: <, >, TAB anywhere in a luacode
      environment caused errors. The character ` was affected too.

2010/12/28 1.07
    * fix two bugs reported by Arno Trautmann that made the package crash with
      luatex 0.65 (mp 1.5+).
    * remove support for using .mem files (to fix the second bug)

2010/10/17 v1.06
    * bugfix from Hans (bad function name)

2010/10/10 v1.05
    * adapt to luatexbase v0.3

2010/08/02 v1.04
    * fixing a bug in LaTeX's detection (made Tikz fail)
    * setting luamplib-luatex as the default name for the format, it's the case
      in TeXLive 2010
    * adding two test files in the git repository

2010/05/10 v1.03
    * adaptation to the new luatexbase package
